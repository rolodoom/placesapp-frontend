## Usage

Clone the source files and navigate into the app's root directory. Run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev` which will open up a preview of the app in your default browser, watch for changes to source files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

## Available Scripts

You must have npm installed in order to use this build environment.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist`. You may deploy this `dist` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

The `vite preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

### More about Deploying a Static Site

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy) on Vite.js for more information.
